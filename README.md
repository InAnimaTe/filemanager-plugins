$ svn co http://svn.rutorrent.org/svn/filemanager/trunk/ 

was run to grab this dir. It contains all the made plugins by hwk that may or may not work together
to provide easier mangability of your downloaded files.

This includes mediamanager for streaming stuff straight from rutorrent, fileupload for uploading
directly and of course his very popular, filemanager. 

You should get it from the original source when available by using that svn copy link above. 

Note that I haven't written or contributed to any of this. This is merely a backup.
